      <h2>Getting started with dancing</h2>
      <p>
        You can dance in a group, with a partner, or on your own. There are lots
        of different places where you can enjoy dancing, for example, at dance
        schools, social venues, community halls and in your own home.
        <span
          >Dancing has become such a popular way to be active and keep fit</span
        >, that most fitness clubs now offer dance classes in their group
        exercise programs. Dancing can be done both competitively and socially.
        It can be a great recreational and sporting choice, because anyone of
        any age can take part. It doesn‚Äôt matter whether it is cold or raining,
        as dancing is usually done indoors. The gear you need for dancing will
        depend on the style of dancing you choose. For example, tap dancing will
        involve buying tap shoes, however many forms of dance do not need
        special equipment or footwear. To get started, simply choose a style you
        enjoy, or would like to try, look online for dance schools in your local
        area and join a class.
